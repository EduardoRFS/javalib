From 1.5 to 1.6
---------------
New features :
* adding a representation for complete programs
* adding a printing module for programs that can output text and html
  code, along with user information
* adding a JPrintHierarchy to print information about the class
  hierarchy, inheritance, overloading, etc.
* adding a ControlFlow module to have some control flow information
  more easily
* adding a lookup function for (loading and writing) individual
  classes in .jar files
* add support for Java 5 flags (enum, synthetic, annotation, bridge,
  varargs, etc.) and improve handling of those flags in general.
* enriching dumping modules to print classes in high or low level
  representation

Changes in the interface :
* classes and interfaces have now different type
* renamed jConsts to jBasics
* moved the definitions of jClassLow also used in jClass to jBasics
* merging OpConst and OpLdc (JDump/JClass/JInstruction) in high level
  class representation
* signatures added to fields and classes in JClass
* the return type has been included in the signature (useful for
  bridge methods)
* method_signature renamed to method_descriptor as it includes the
  return type wich is not part of the signature
* more accurate (and cumbersome) typing for access flags in JClassLow
* some renaming so names should be more 'logic'

Minor changes in the code :
* add more access functions to classes and interfaces
* more consistent treatment of exceptions in all the library
* adding some checks on bytecode generation (JCode)
* adding some checks on conversion (JLow2High)
* some code factorizing (is_dir/is_file) in JFile, for the constant
  pool accesses and in the representation of abstract and concrete
  classes

Bug fix :
* bugfix : in unparsing line number tables
* bugfix : in JDumpBasics.object_value_signature
* bugfix : in JFile, correct a bug when trying to open an nonexistent
  file
* bugfix : in (un-)parsing of BIPush
* bugfix : a ConstantValue attribute was expected for non-static
  fields
* bugfix : in JLow2High : unexpected attributes were causing the
  conversion to fail (it now works and prints a warning)
* bugfix : in JLow2High
* bugfix : in JHigh2Low : correcting some bugs with abstract classes
  and methods
* fix encoding problems in documentation 
* Removed the extlib patch (included in extlib 1.5.1)


From 1.4 to 1.5
---------------
* new type for bytecode instructions (more generic opcodes)
* the low level instructions are still available, and even more low
  level
* change many base types to reflect more accurately the constraints of
  the specification
* fix bugs and change some small other stuff
