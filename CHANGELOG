From 1.8 to 1.8.1
---------------
New features:
* new HTML printer function for programs (cleaner and easier to
  navigate through)
* stub generator for native methods for RTA (only for Linux)

Changes in the interface:
  There should be no change in the interface

Minor changes in the code:
* Printing a warnings when parsing native methods in RTA and no stub
  is found
* Removing some dead code in JRTA
* Improving some error messages (in JLow2High)

Bugfixes:
* bugfix (under windows): class path separator is now a semi-colon on
  windows
* bugfix (RTA): load java.lang.Class when encountering ldc instruction
* bugfix: when (un)parsing some code, the bytecode representation
  could change if the first was not optimal in terms of size (eg. an
  iload_1 coded as an iload 1)
* bugfix (get_local_variable_info): a heuristic was used to determined
  the length of the store instruction, it is now the proper length
* bugfix (jDumpLow): jsr and ret were printed as goto
* bugfix: retw(209) not documented => removed

From 1.7.1 to 1.8
-----------------
The licence has been changed from the GPL to the LGPL.

New features:
* efficient RTA implementation for program loading and callgraph
  computation
* much more efficient (and precise, and simpler to use) static lookup
  functions (in JControlFlow) (based on JRTA)
* JPrint can now output the local variable names in the bytecode output
* a Patricia Tree library has been added and can be used by the client
  code

Changes in the interface:
* numbering of class names, field signature and method signature in
  the program representation (which implies changes in loads of
  function signatures)
* JProgram has been splited in 2 : JProgram and JCRA. JRTA (a
  replacement for JCRA) has been added.
* adding a function to retrieve the name and signature of a local
  variable
* adding a function to retrieve the source line number corresponding
  to a bytecode instruction
* adding JDumpBasics.arraytype2shortstring
* JProgram.get_fields now returns the list of fields instead of the
  list of indexes (same price, more information)

Minor changes in the code:
* adding a way to tune javalib to be either more or less
  permissive (some consistency checks are only done in permissive
  mode)
* pprint_*_to_html_file now takes the introduction string instead
  of a file as first argument.  It is more flexible as the user
  can also load the string from a file.
* very small optimizations (avoid recomputing some operations, use a
  unsafe_get instead of get, order some tests based on their costs)
* using Patricia Trees instead of Sets or Maps when applicable
* adding the method called by SUN's VM at startup in the list of entry
  points

Bugfixes:
* several bugfix in JControlFlow

From 1.7 to 1.7.1
-----------------
Bugfixes:
* the JFile.mkdir function could produce a stack overflow if the
  directory passed as argument is not a sub-directory of the current
  directory. Bug reported by Samuel Hym. This bug is present in
  JavaLib 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7.
* the JHigh2Low.h2l_code2attribute function was using lazy functions
  that were evaluated after that the constant pool were modified,
  which could cause bugs if the constant pool was emptied before
  unparsing the class. Bug reported by Samuel Hym. This bug is present
  in JavaLib 1.7.

From 1.6 to 1.7
---------------
New features:
* add lazy code parsing: the compiled code attribute is copied into
  the memory but not parsed before it is actually needed.  Copying the
  code attribute allows not to refer to the .class file anymore so
  they can be garbage collected.  Tests that load classes without
  looking at the actual code attributes shows an improvement of 22%
  and 23% of time and memory consumption, respectively.
* it is now possible for JFile.class_path to load the .jar files that
  the given directories contain (so the CLASSPATH environment variable
  can be used as the argument of the function)

Changes in the interface:
* adding version numbers to class file representations (so JUnparse
  output the right version number).  (Note: the current implementation
  does not check that the features actually used match the declared
  version number)
* merge Parse_error, Illegal_value and Class_structure_error
  exception into Class_structure_error exception.
* handling Java 5 signatures for generics (some old signature or
  name_and_type have been renamed to descriptor when appropriate) to
  jProgram, jClass and jClassLow and update handling code (jPrint,
  jDumpLow, jParse, jUnparse, jH2L, jL2H)
* adding attribute EnclosingMethod (introduced with Java 5 for local
  classes) (jProgram, jClass, jClassLow) and update handling code
  (jPrint, jDumpLow, jParse, jUnparse, jH2L, jL2H)
* adding attribute SourceDebugExtension (jProgram, jClass, jClassLow)
  and corresponding handling code (jPrint, jDumpLow, jParse, jUnparse,
  jH2L, jL2H)

Minor changes in the code:
* closing the class_path when the program is loaded (should free some
  memory)
* tableswitch and lookupswitch instructions are now printed
  with all the details (instead of just <...>)
* adding a constraint check on the maximum size of the code attribute
  (65536)
* when an error occurs in low2high_class, it now gives the class name
  in the error message
* improving the documentation

Bugfixes:
* bugfix: replace IO.nread with IO.really_nread as it would be an
  error to read less bytes than what is excepted.
* bugfix: it is now be possible to have more than one
  LocalVariableTable per code attribute (there can be one per local
  variable)


From 1.5 to 1.6
---------------
New features :
* adding a representation for complete programs
* adding a printing module for programs that can output text and html
  code, along with user information
* adding a JPrintHierarchy to print information about the class
  hierarchy, inheritance, overloading, etc.
* adding a ControlFlow module to have some control flow information
  more easily
* adding a lookup function for (loading and writing) individual
  classes in .jar files
* add support for Java 5 flags (enum, synthetic, annotation, bridge,
  varargs, etc.) and improve handling of those flags in general.
* enriching dumping modules to print classes in high or low level
  representation

Changes in the interface :
* classes and interfaces have now different type
* renamed jConsts to jBasics
* moved the definitions of jClassLow also used in jClass to jBasics
* merging OpConst and OpLdc (JDump/JClass/JInstruction) in high level
  class representation
* signatures added to fields and classes in JClass
* the return type has been included in the signature (useful for
  bridge methods)
* method_signature renamed to method_descriptor as it includes the
  return type wich is not part of the signature
* more accurate (and cumbersome) typing for access flags in JClassLow
* some renaming so names should be more 'logic'

Minor changes in the code :
* add more access functions to classes and interfaces
* more consistent treatment of exceptions in all the library
* adding some checks on bytecode generation (JCode)
* adding some checks on conversion (JLow2High)
* some code factorizing (is_dir/is_file) in JFile, for the constant
  pool accesses and in the representation of abstract and concrete
  classes

Bug fix :
* bugfix : in unparsing line number tables
* bugfix : in JDumpBasics.object_value_signature
* bugfix : in JFile, correct a bug when trying to open an nonexistent
  file
* bugfix : in (un-)parsing of BIPush
* bugfix : a ConstantValue attribute was expected for non-static
  fields
* bugfix : in JLow2High : unexpected attributes were causing the
  conversion to fail (it now works and prints a warning)
* bugfix : in JLow2High
* bugfix : in JHigh2Low : correcting some bugs with abstract classes
  and methods
* fix encoding problems in documentation 
* Removed the extlib patch (included in extlib 1.5.1)


From 1.4 to 1.5
---------------
* new type for bytecode instructions (more generic opcodes)
* the low level instructions are still available, and even more low
  level
* change many base types to reflect more accurately the constraints of
  the specification
* fix bugs and change some small other stuff

From 1.0 to 1.4
---------------
This version adds a lot of features (and fixes some bugs) to the latest
version (1.0) distributed by Nicolas Cannasse while keeping an almost
compatible interface.  The differences in the compatible interfaces
includes :
- a few changes in the instruction set
- the AttributeStackMap constructor
- the AccRFU constructor
- an additional parameter in the function JCode.parse_opcode
