Here is some stuff that need to be done:
* Correctness
- take in account visibility in JProgram (lookups and resolves of fields
  and methods)
- test lookups and resolves by comparing with jvm traces

* Extra functionalities
- check the compatibility of JavaLib with Java 5, Java 6 and Java 7
- we should define equal on JProgram.program (and JClassLow.jclass) to
  be able to do some more serious tests
- jDumpLow : should we dump the constant pool? (it seems many other
  things are not dump by jDumpLow, but JPrint and jLow2High offer much
  more)
- try to see if the dependency to unix.cma can be removed
