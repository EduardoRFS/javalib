Here is some stuff that need to be done:
- add fields "other_flags" to field/method/class/inner_class records
- jDump : we should dump the constant pool, the tableswitch and
  lookupswith instructions
- it seems that many things are not dump by jDump
- adapt JDump to dump high level classes
- adopt a more uniform naming convention between JClass and JClassLow
- check : an interface can contains a class initializer
  (ex:com/sun/imageio/plugins/bmp/BMPConstants) and it is not
  documented
- use a well-defined set of exceptions (remove failwith)
- add lazy parsing (keeping the code attributes unparsed until really
  needed) (think of marshaling and compacity)
- add "lazy loading": automatically load from a class-path classes
  that are needed by the 'main' classes (it's to avoid loading the
  full run-time, but just the part used by the current program)
- take in account visibility in JProgram (lookups and resolves of fields
  and methods)
- test lookups and resolves by comparing with jvm traces
- JControlFlow : improve precession of exceptional_successors by
  pruning edges to handles of subclasses of java.lang.Exception and
  not subclasses of java.lang.RuntimeException for instruction that
  are known not to throw declared exception (should be everything
  except method calls).
- we should define equal on JProgram.program (and JClassLow.jclass) to
  be able to do some more serious tests
