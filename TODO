Here is some stuff that need to be done:
* Correctness
- take in account visibility in JProgram (lookups and resolves of fields
  and methods)
- test lookups and resolves by comparing with jvm traces

* Compatibility with Java 5
- replace some assert with a global boolean that state whether
  consistency must be checked or if the analysis must be as permissive
  as possible
- parametrize some function with the version number so features
  introduced in Java 5 or Java 6 are not applyed to old files
- Add AttributeLocalVariableTypeTable (see §4.8.13)
  (LocalVariableTable for generics)
- Add AttributeRuntimeVisibleAnnotations (see §4.8.15)
- Add AttributeRuntimeInvisibleAnnotations (see §4.8.16)
- Add AttributeRuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations (see §4.8.17)
- Add AttributeRuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations (see §4.8.18)
- Add AttributeAnnotationDefault (see §4.8.19)
- Check modifications of UTF8 encoding (§4.5.7)

* Compatibility with Java 6
- handle StackMapTable attribute

* Extra functionalities
- Use AttributeSignature to print signatures of methods, fields and
  class if present (case of generics)
- we should define equal on JProgram.program (and JClassLow.jclass) to
  be able to do some more serious tests
- jDumpLow : should we dump the constant pool? (it seems many other
  things are not dump by jDumpLow, but JPrint and jLow2High offer much
  more)
- check the compatibility of JavaLib with Java 7
- try to see if the dependency to unix.cma can be removed
