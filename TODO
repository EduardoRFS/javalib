Here is some stuff that need to be done:
- add fields "other_flags" to field/method/class/inner_class records
- currently, when using JClass, one has to open JClassLow, 
   we should try to avoid that
- jDump : we should dump the constant pool, the tableswitch and lookupswith instructions
- it seems that many things are not dump by jDump
- adopt a more uniform naming convention between JClass and JClassLow
- adapt JDump to dump high level classes
- check : an interface can contains a class initializer
  (ex:com/sun/imageio/plugins/bmp/BMPConstants) and it is not
  documented
- use a well-defined set of exceptions (remove failwith)
