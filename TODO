Here is some stuff that need to be done:
* Correctness
- take in account visibility in JProgram (lookups and resolves of fields
  and methods)
- test lookups and resolves by comparing with jvm traces

* Extra functionalities
- JFile : the classpath should not contain the [.jar] files but only
  directories and the jar files should be looked for in the given
  directories.
- jDump : we should dump the constant pool, the tableswitch and
  lookupswith instructions (it seems that many things are not dump by
  jDumpLow)
- JControlFlow : improve precession of exceptional_successors by
  pruning edges to handles of subclasses of java.lang.Exception and
  not subclasses of java.lang.RuntimeException for instruction that
  are known not to throw declared exception (should be everything
  except method calls).
- add class file version number to class file representation
- check the compatibility of JavaLib with Java 5, Java 6 and Java 7
- we should define equal on JProgram.program (and JClassLow.jclass) to
  be able to do some more serious tests
- try to see if the dependency to unix.cma can be removed
