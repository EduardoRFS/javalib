Here is some stuff that need to be done:
* Correctness
- take in account visibility in JProgram (lookups and resolves of fields
  and methods)
- test lookups and resolves by comparing with jvm traces
- BUG: it should be possible to have more than one LocalVariableTable
  per code attribute (there can be one per local variable) (jLow2High)

* Compatibility with Java 5
- Add AttributeSignature to jClassLow and jClass and update handling
  code (JL2H, JH2L, jParse/jUnparse) (see §4.4.4 and §4.8.8)
- Use AttributeSignature to print signatures of methods, fields and
  class if present (case of generics)SourceDebugExtension
- Add AttributeEnclosingMethod to jClassLow and jClass and update
  handling code (JL2H, JH2L, jParse/jUnparse)
- Add AttributeLocalVariableTypeTable (see §4.8.13)
  (LocalVariableTable for generics)
- Add AttributeRuntimeVisibleAnnotations (see §4.8.15)
- Add AttributeRuntimeInvisibleAnnotations (see §4.8.16)
- Add AttributeRuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations (see §4.8.17)
- Add AttributeRuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations (see §4.8.18)
- Add AttributeAnnotationDefault (see §4.8.19)
- Check modifications of UTF8 encoding (§4.5.7)

* Extra functionalities
- check the compatibility of JavaLib with Java 5, Java 6 and Java 7
- we should define equal on JProgram.program (and JClassLow.jclass) to
  be able to do some more serious tests
- jDumpLow : should we dump the constant pool? (it seems many other
  things are not dump by jDumpLow, but JPrint and jLow2High offer much
  more)
- try to see if the dependency to unix.cma can be removed
