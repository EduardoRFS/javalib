 - Any reason why Camlzip is not compiled by the toplevel Make?
   <- Yes, it's independent. We could check it as a dependency in the toplevel
      Make / in a Configure (see below), though.
 - Can we get ocamlfind to install locally? 
   -> 'ocamlfind install -destdir' + edit the path in /etc/ocamlfind.conf
   ->              "               + set the global variable OCAMLPATH      <- GO
 - Is there a need for a configure phase/file?
   -> To check whether a global or local install is required
     -> To set/source the OCAMLPATH (see ocamlfind/findlib)
   -> To check is RECODE is present/needed
   -> To set a compilation flag for camlzip
