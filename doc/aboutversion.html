<h2>About this Version</h2>

The major improvement brough by this version is the efficient
implementation of RTA (Rapid Type Analysis - it is a control flow
analysis).  It used to load the programs and can then be used for free
by the client code.  Know bugs have been fixed and there are some
other changes described in the CHANGELOG file.  The parts of JavaLib
related to the notion of program (and not only class file) have been
heavily modified and updating your code to this new version may need
some work.  The other parts of JavaLib have not changed much and
adapting your code to this new version should be simple.
