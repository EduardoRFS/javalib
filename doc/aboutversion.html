<h2>About this Version</h2>

The major difference brough by this version 2 is the clearer definition of the
purpose of the library: it is meant to handled classes, not programs.  Parts of
the library have been removed and put in the brand new library: Sawja.  The
improvements brought in this version of Javalib are mainly focused on the
documentation, the interfaces (which means a new user of the library should only
have 3 files to look at), and the overall efficiency (using hash consing, which
then allows to use Patricia Trees for maps and sets).
