<h2>About this Version</h2>
<p>
This version (2.1.1) contains only 2 minors changes: removing some debugging
messages and fix version number in META file.
</p>
<p>
The major difference brought by version 2.1 is the parsing and
unparsing of Java 5 annotations. All modules of <em>Javalib</em> are now
sub-modules of the module Javalib_pack in order to avoid namespace
conflicts. Compilation and installation processes changes: a configure
script has been added, installation process now rely on FindLib. Some
bufixes were done (see CHANGELOG for details).
