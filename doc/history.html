<h2>Some History</h2>


<p>JavaLib was initially developped by Nicolas Cannasse.</p>

<p>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Besson made some corrections.</p>

<p>Laurent Hubert &lt;first.last@irisa.fr&gt; then modified it during
an internship at IRISA (Rennes, France) in the Lande team, during the
summer 2005.</p>

<p>&Eacute;tienne Andr&eacute; then modified it during an internship
at IRISA in the Lande team, between March and July 2006.  These
modifications mainly concerned an error about the "wide" instruction,
which was definitely not properly coded.</p>

<p>Tiphaine Turpin &lt;first.last@irisa.fr&gt; added the unparsing feature
and greatly improved the loading features (module JFile).</p>

<p>Tiphaine Turpin and Laurent Hubert then added the high level
representation of classes.</p>

<p>Laurent Hubert added, among other things, a representation for
programs, a control flow module, a pretty-printer for classes and
programs and the lazing parsing which greatly improves performances
when only some methods are actually used. </p>

<p>Nicolas Barr&eacute; coded an efficient RTA algorithm to improve
the precision of the control flow graph and to reduce the size of the
programs loaded.</p>
