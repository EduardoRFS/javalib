INTRODUCTION
------------
 
JavaLib is a library to access .class files from OCaml.
Look at sample.ml sources to see how you can parse and dump a class file.
The command "sample Main.class" will parse and dump the class file.

with the following exceptions:

AUTHORS
-------

JavaLib was initially developped by Nicolas Cannasse <ncannasse@motion-twin.com>.

Frédéric Besson made some corrections.

Laurent Hubert then modified it during an internship at IRISA (Rennes, France)
in the Lande team, during the summer 2005.

Étienne André then modified it during an internship at IRISA
in the Lande team, between March and July 2006.
These modifications mainly concerned an error about the "wide"
instruction, which was definitely not properly coded.

Tiphaine Turpin <Tiphaine Turpin <first.last@irisa.fr>> added the unparsing feature.
