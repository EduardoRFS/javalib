INTRODUCTION
------------
 
JavaLib is a library to access .class files from OCaml.
Look at sample.ml sources to see how you can parse and dump a class file.
The command "sample Main.class" will parse and dump the class file.


ABOUT THIS VERSION
------------------

This version improves the class and interface representations by
providing more precise types for data and more logical names.  This
new version also includes a representation for complete programs, some
ways to compute information on those programs with a control flow
module and a module to get information about the class hierarchy,
overloading inheritance, etc.  It also improves the supports flags in
general and specially those of Java 5.  Know bugs have been fixed and
there are some other changes described in the CHANGELOG file.  All
this comes at the price of an incompatibility with the previous
version.

SOME HISTORY
------------

JavaLib was initially developped by Nicolas Cannasse.

Frédéric Besson made some corrections.

Laurent Hubert <first.last@irisa.fr> then modified it during an
internship at IRISA (Rennes, France) in the Lande team, during the
summer 2005.

Étienne André then modified it during an internship at IRISA in the
Lande team, between March and July 2006.  These modifications mainly
concerned an error about the "wide" instruction, which was definitely
not properly coded.

Tiphaine Turpin <first.last@irisa.fr> added the unparsing feature
and greatly improved the loading features ({!JFile}).

Tiphaine Turpin and Laurent Hubert then added the high level
representation of classes.

Laurent Hubert added a representation for programs, a control flow
module, and a pretty-printer for classes and programs.
