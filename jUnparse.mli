(* Unparses a class to a file. Provided constants are kept unchanged.
   Missing constant are added at the end of the constant pool if
   needed. The Code attribute for methods is assumed to be such that
   the distance between the offset of two successive non-OpInvalid
   instructions is at least the length of the optimal coding for
   the first instruction (for example, iload_0 vs iload 0). The code
   is padded with nops if this length is shorter. OpWides are
   ignored, i.e., an instruction preceded by an OpWide is written at
   the offset of the OpWide. Note that the constants refered to by
   a ldc-like instruction should be present in the provided constant
   pool at an index that is compatible with their length: if a wide
   form is needed but the instruction was read as a "simple" form,
   the writing will fail. *)
